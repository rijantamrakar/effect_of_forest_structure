It is necessary that I know what I do daily.

1. Learnt git hub and now have learnt how to branch.
2. Comparing different sets of flux data (fluxnet, and PI)
3. Plot structural indices versus annual statistics of carbon dioxide fluxes.

1. added anomaly calculation
2. plotted daily anomaly files in pdf with removed and not removed trend.
3. Prepared the meeting presentations

1. daily timeseries function improved
2. daily anomalies calculated and plotted.

1. Calculated anomaly however there were issues with structural data.
2. Found the plot size mistake in US-UMB and corrected.
3. checking issues in US-NR1 diameter data
4. corrected some bugs in diameter distribution function
5. Produced a beautiful corellelogram

Date:  20180720
1. Prepared the corellelogram plot on structural index
2. Worked on annual GPPsat
3. Map Produced

1. Prepare more details of the site
2. Be careful with naming, it can help you a lot.
  2.1 Always start data name in R with 'Data', 'Plot'
3. Started to collect some site data.
4. Let me work on annual data first
5. Talked to mark and I confused myself more
6. Learnt a bit about fourier transformation and anomaly detection but I didn't
    understand anything.
