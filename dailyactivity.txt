It is necessary that I know what I do daily.

Date: 20180703
1. Learnt git hub and now have learnt how to branch.
2. Comparing different sets of flux data (fluxnet, and PI)
3. Plot structural indices versus annual statistics of carbon dioxide fluxes.

Date: 20180704
1. added anomaly calculation
2. plotted daily anomaly files in pdf with removed and not removed trend.
3. Prepared the meeting presentations

Date: 20180709
1. daily timeseries function improved
2. daily anomalies calculated and plotted.

Date: 20180710
1. Calculated anomaly however there were issues with structural data.
2. Found the plot size mistake in US-UMB and corrected.
3. checking issues in US-NR1 diameter data
4. corrected some bugs in diameter distribution function
5. Produced a beautiful corellelogram

Date:  20180720
1. Prepared the corellelogram plot on structural index
2. Worked on annual GPPsat
3. Map Produced

Date: 20180720
1. Prepare more details of the site
2. Be careful with naming, it can help you a lot.
  2.1 Always start data name in R with 'Data', 'Plot'
3. Started to collect some site data.
4. Let me work on annual data first
5. Talked to mark and I confused myself more
6. Learnt a bit about fourier transformation and anomaly detection but I didn't
    understand anything.

1. Refreshed my computer by installing fresh windows and programs. Let me not
pollute it anymore with undesirable programs and viruses. Let me be very careful
while choosing things for myself. I must protect myself and my computer from
more dirty things.

2. Pushed all the files to the remote server.

Date: 20180823 planned
1. Download ERA-interim data at daily scale.
2. Download spei values at monthly and yearly scale.
3. Calculate spei values from own data using spei package.
4. Build simple bucket model for calculating soil water.

Date: 20180823
1. Write a latex file for the activity/method
2. Prepare script to download ERA-interim data

Date: 20180824
1. Preparing soil water model from SWUF and Biljou in R

Date: 20181009
1. Daily soil water model is complete, use it when I do daily analysis.
2. Get monthly and annual SPEI values for different sites.
