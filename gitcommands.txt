It is very important that I learn to use git. Here are some of the very basic
commands.

1. git init // initiate git it the folder.
2. git status // to check what has been modified or added in the folder
3. git add . // to add the modified/added files in the staging area.
4. git commit -m 'changes made'// to change the modified files.

//adding things to the online repository
1. git remote add origin <remote_repo_url>
2. git push origin

// branching and merging in git hub
1. git checkout -b <branch name> // creating a branch for working
2. git checkout <branch name> // for changing the branch
3. git push --set-upstream origin ver20180703
4. Once every work is done following is the command to merge the file
git merge <branch name>
5. git branch -d <branch name>
